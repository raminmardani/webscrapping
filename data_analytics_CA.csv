Still founder-led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Fairbank, Capital One is on a mission to help our customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking. We measure our efforts by the success our customers enjoy and the advocacy they exhibit. We are succeeding because they are succeeding.

Guided by our shared values, we thrive in an environment where collaboration and openness are valued. We believe that innovation is powered by perspective and that teamwork and respect for each other lead to superior results. We elevate each other and obsess about doing the right thing. Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.
Data Scientist
At Capital One, data is at the center of everything we do. When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988! Fast-forward a few years, and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to a Fortune 200 company and a leader in the world of data-driven decision-making.
As a Data Scientist at Capital One, you’ll be part of a team that’s leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money, time, and agony in their financial lives.
On any given day, you’ll be:
Writing software to clean and investigate large, messy data sets of numerical and textual data
Integrating with internal and external data sources and APIs to discover interesting trends
Building machine learning models (Linear and Logistic regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, etc.) from development, validation, through to deployment in production
Designing rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers or company leaders
Investigating the impact of new technologies on the future of digital banking and the financial world of tomorrow
The Ideal Candidate will be:
Curious: You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to blurt out your disruptive idea. You probably know Python, Scala, or R and are constantly exploring new open source tools, and hitting up stack overflow on a regular basis.
A Wrangler: You know how to programmatically extract data from a database and an API, bring it through a transformation or two, and model it into a human-readable form (Matplotlib, d3 visualization, Tableau, etc.).
Creative: Big, undefined problems and petabytes of data don't frighten you. You’re used to working with abstract data, and you love discovering new narratives in unmined territories.
Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.
Benefits
Your choice of hardware - latest MacBook Pro or HP EliteBook and all the monitors you want!
Travel to a conference of your choice annually (senior+) - PyCon, PyData, AWS re:Invent, KDD, etc.
$5000/yr education budget

Job Summary
The big picture
One of CSE’s mandates is to provide the Government of Canada with unique information derived from foreign electronic emissions. That information is known as signals intelligence, or SIGINT. Foreign Language Intelligence Analysts play an essential role in producing SIGINT, by performing timely, accurate analyses and preparing high-quality reports. Those reports help federal government and Canadian Forces officials make the right decisions to safeguard Canada’s interests and protect Canadians' lives.
What an analyst does
So what might you expect to do in an average day? For security reasons, we can’t provide a detailed work description here, but we can tell you that your specific tasks may vary substantially between assignments or even from time to time during the same assignment. You may be asked to work primarily with intelligence data that has already been collected: you will read or listen to foreign language material, determine its relevance and importance, produce a translation or transcript if necessary, and then draft reports based on the information of intelligence value in the material. All these activities may require you to do extensive research on the subject matter and to draw on your understanding of the culture concerned.
On the other hand, you could be given a new intelligence requirement and asked to determine how the information could be collected. To do so, you may have to analyze social networks, communications infrastructure, and mountains of raw data. This too may require you to do in-depth research and also to collaborate with technical experts in other parts of CSE. Other assignments may include tasks from both ends of this spectrum.
What’s in it for you?
Are you intrigued yet? Here are some more reasons why you should consider applying for a Foreign Language Intelligence Analyst position:
The work is unique and varied. It will challenge you and keep you coming back for more.
You will have opportunities to use your foreign language skills and your other talents on a daily basis.
You will have opportunities to develop your strengths and learn new skills.
The work you do will make a difference and could save lives.
You will enjoy a unique perspective on world affairs, seeing the story behind the news or even witnessing developments as they happen.

Position Type
Permanent positions, with a one (1) year probation period.

Salary Range
UNI 06 - $70,269 to $82,670 per year.
UNI 07 - $78,001 to $91,764 per year

Position Requirements
Foreign language skills
Our foreign language requirements vary over time, but we have a continuing need for Middle Eastern, Asian, North African, West African and European languages.
Ideally, you will have advanced proficiency in both listening and reading in the language. “Advanced proficiency” means full comprehension of the language as it is used by educated native speakers. However, we may consider your application if you have only listening proficiency in a language that uses an alphabetic form of writing, and you are willing to take a course to acquire the necessary reading skills.
You don’t have to have a university degree, certification as a translator or any other formal qualification.
Other skills
Foreign language proficiency is just one of the qualities we look for. You also need:
a high level of analytical ability to assess the intelligence value of incoming data, select the information that meets the Canadian government’s intelligence requirements, and prepare accurate, concise reports;
sound judgement;
an aptitude for research; and
a well-rounded knowledge of world affairs.
You must be comfortable with information technology (IT) and willing to learn more about computers, networks and telecommunications.
You must be able to work effectively with other analysts in a team environment. Because our work environment is so dynamic, you must be versatile and adaptable. If you don’t like change, this is not the job for you.

The project has been pre-selected based on its compatibility with the Intern Program and CFIB’s legislative agenda. We strongly encourage interested candidates to check out our research and advocacy work at www.cfib.ca. At the end of four months, the project may be considered a component of CFIB’s public advocacy work on these issues.

$2,500/month gross (paid bi-weekly, less statutory deductions)

Writing sample:
This application process requires a sample of written work you have completed. The writing sample should be a brief example of your research and writing abilities. The sample does not necessarily have to be related to small business issues. For example, you may want to use a portion of a paper that you submitted for a school course. Please keep your writing sample to two pages. If needed, further samples may be requested from short-listed candidates.

535,Quantitative Researcher (Alternative Data),Quandl Inc,"Toronto, ON",30+ days ago,"Toronto, ONThe Opportunity
Quandl is a data platform used by over 400,000 people, including thousands of analysts from the world's top hedge funds, asset managers and investment banks. Professionals use Quandl for our rich suite of databases and unrivaled data consumption experience.
A key part of our offering is ""Alternative Data"": obscure, rare or esoteric datasets from unusual or untapped sources that are not widely used by Wall Street firms. Examples include intercompany transaction and supply chain data, sentiment measures derived from natural language processing, tracking of vehicles via GPS transponders, satellite monitoring of industrial facilities, footfall and geolocation data, and consumer insights gleaned from anonymized credit card transactions.
These datasets are often considered ""alternative"" because they do not fall in the traditional categories of data used by the financial industry: stock prices, company fundamentals, options and futures, and so forth. Their importance in the financial markets is increasing rapidly as hedge funds and active asset managers are eager for data that offers predictive insights about the performance of individual companies, sectors, and the economy as a whole.
As the world's leading provider of Alternative Data, we deliver innovative products that power some of the most successful firms on Wall Street. We welcome you to join us in our journey, as we continue to redefine the investment landscape.


The Role
Quandl is currently seeking Quantitative Researchers to join our Alternative Data team. Multiple positions are available at an Intermediate to Senior level.

Detect, confirm, and amplify predictive signals in the data while filtering out non-relevant information

At VISO, we’re always searching for ways to innovate. Whether in our groundbreaking custom lighting designs, our company culture, or our business strategies, we know that being better is the only way forward. That spirit has fueled our success for over 25 years, and has driven us to be unique, uncompromising, and exceptional in everything we do.

Now we’re looking to add a new member to our analytics team: someone with expertise, technical ability, and a positive, collaborative attitude.

That’s where you come in

As our new Business Analyst, you’ll be responsible for a range of financial duties: things like reporting, data management, costing and analysis.

A big part of this role involves working with our new ERP software, EPICOR. Here you’ll manage end to end business processes, and identify, define, and analyze business requirements. You’ll also support our software transition by being a resource for EPICOR, and contribute to change and product management.

Succeeding in this role means always looking forward to new opportunities, whether that involves improving our systems for efficiency, finding new applications, or furthering our business goals.

Takes initiative – you have the drive and independence to finish projects and tasks on your own, and know how to meet deadlines.
Loves learning – constant improvement is your motto: you are an innovator who’s always looking for a better way.
Excels in group settings – you’re as good with people as you are with analysis, and can use strong interpersonal skills to collaborate with anyone who can lend a hand.
Thinks creatively – you’re strategic and excel in problem solving. You aren’t afraid to try different approaches, and know how to switch tactics when things aren’t working.
Working @ Viso

This will be a full-time, permanent position with hours from 9-5, Monday to Friday. We offer a competitive compensation package, which includes a salary between $70,000 and $85,000 per year, commensurate with your experience. You’ll also get full medical and dental after a trial period, as well as free parking, and potential for bonuses.

We do work culture a little bit differently at VISO. Or office is pet friendly, and we encourage people to be themselves at work. As a group we love collaboration, and maintaining the fun, positive, family-like environment of our workplace is a top priority.

If you want to join a team that’s supportive and always looking to do better, we want to hear from you.

Quandl is a data platform used by over 400,000 people, including thousands of analysts from the world's top hedge funds, asset managers and investment banks. Professionals use Quandl for our rich suite of databases and unrivaled data consumption experience.
A key part of our offering is ""Alternative Data"": obscure, rare or esoteric datasets from unusual or untapped sources that are not widely used by Wall Street firms. Examples include intercompany transaction and supply chain data, sentiment measures derived from natural language processing, tracking of vehicles via GPS transponders, satellite monitoring of industrial facilities, footfall and geolocation data, and consumer insights gleaned from anonymized credit card transactions.
These datasets are often considered ""alternative"" because they do not fall in the traditional categories of data used by the financial industry: stock prices, company fundamentals, options and futures, and so forth. Their importance in the financial markets is increasing rapidly as hedge funds and active asset managers are eager for data that offers predictive insights about the performance of individual companies, sectors, and the economy as a whole.
