You focus on impact over hard work: what isn't of a concern is the hours you work, but your results and impact on team members and customers
You like to solve difficult problems, together: no one said transforming banking was going to be easy, but we’re collectively reimagining it and there are no solo heroes welcome
You operate with a mentality of Build-Measure-Learn: our agile mindset is not just for our technical teams, it's a mindset that every one of us is asked to operate from. We move fast, we make mistakes but we measure the impact, learn, grow and change as a result
You focus on 10X and leave the incremental thinking at home: if something doesn't have significant impact, you are the person to challenge whether or not it's worth doing
You do it with passion or not at all: you’re inspired by our purpose and you see the link between yourself and the work you are doing to transform banking
You’re comfortable with being uncomfortable: we won’t always have the answers and change is a constant in our world. As a Transformer you trust in our vision and own an attitude of willingness and patience
You keep the customer at the heart of everything you do: Empathy is a core driver in which you navigate the world. You don’t build products, processes and solutions for the sake of checking something off your checklist, you build with the end user in mind, openly engaging new ideas, listening with intent and making decisions with the desire to balance both compassion with logical reasoning.
As a team member with the Transformation team at ATB, you can expect:
No day will ever be the same - we’re learning, iterating and making big steps towards our vision of transforming an entire industry, everyday
The ability to grow a career within an inspiring, impact focused culture where you are surrounded by changemakers and leaders that empower you to use your voice to make banking work for people
To be a part of the energy of an organization that is unlike any other, where you may pinch yourself on the daily and wonder how you got so lucky
Bragging rights! You get to call yourself a Transformer and an ATBer and know you play a direct role in helping us become a cutting edge financial institution (it’s going to feel more like a technology company, but either way it’s hella cool.)

And being part of ATB Financial you get:
An excellent benefits and pension package, opportunities for career advancement, and a financial institution that’s leading the way in change – now you’re talking about a career with a company that allows you to grow.
Amazing benefits for your everyday banking, mortgages, loans and investments needs.

Although not a household name, State Street is one of the world’s largest and most important financial services institutions, providing round-the-clock services to the global investment community. We touch $33 trillion in assets every day and are the world’s third largest investment manager with over $2.8 trillion in assets under management. To do this we manage as much data as one of the internet giants on nearly as large a technical footprint.
In 2018, we launched one of the industry’s largest technical transformation projects, in effect building a new bank from the ground up. This project isn’t greenfield in the way most banks claim projects are; we’ve started with a blank sheet of paper both operationally and technically. We’re using the same technologies that Silicon Valley giants are using: use of multiple public clouds, building our own private cloud to achieve even better performance, transforming our industry through distributed ledger technology and machine learning.
This isn’t a traditional banking role. This is a chance to push your technical skills with people more comfortable in a technology firm than an investment bank, though solving real problems that affect anyone with any form of savings worldwide (not just trying to get people to click on ads).

You will be a key influencer in shaping the end to end ‘NoOps’ flow using cutting edge perspectives from our patent holding architects, process specialists. In addition, you will help shape the toolchain needed to deliver the desired experience. This role will require critical thinking necessary for diligent research into inherent tradeoffs around feasibility, cost, compatibility, etc.
Collaborate with product owners, scrum masters and architects in refining stories for proposed epics
Define end user ‘journey maps’ through process specifications and key interaction points, using ITIL processes to aid alignment with public cloud based capabilities
Map capabilities needed for journey mapping to application components and define approach for managing interim workarounds and process exceptions
Write design specifications with input from developers to aid configuration and development in a verifiable manner
Develop test cases to aid in verification of enabled processes
Who you are
General knowledge of agile software development concepts and processes (e.g., scrum, Kanban, etc.)
Understanding of DevOps principles (e.g., continuous integration and continuous delivery concepts)
Familiarity in journey mapping concepts and developing processes flows focused on addressing prioritized pain points
Ability to clearly translate business requirements into technical requirements
Ability to analyze and document complex business processes and propose redesigns or areas for improvements
Demonstrated ownership of test plan development and iteration-level testing
Understanding and comfort with the latest technologies used in the development, testing and monitoring of custom applications within a cloud environment
Bachelor’s degree in a Computer Science or related field

You focus on 10X and leave the incremental thinking at home: if something doesn't have significant impact, you are the person to challenge whether or not it's worth doing
You do it with passion or not at all: you’re inspired by our purpose and you see the link between yourself and the work you are doing to transform banking
You’re comfortable with being uncomfortable: we won’t always have the answers and change is a constant in our world. As a Transformer you trust in our vision and own an attitude of willingness and patience
You keep the customer at the heart of everything you do: Empathy is a core driver in which you navigate the world. You don’t build products, processes and solutions for the sake of checking something off your checklist, you build with the end user in mind, openly engaging new ideas, listening with intent and making decisions with the desire to balance both compassion with logical reasoning.

As a team member with the Transformation team at ATB, you can expect:
No day will ever be the same - we’re learning, iterating and making big steps towards our vision of transforming an entire industry, everyday
The ability to grow a career within an inspiring, impact focused culture where you are surrounded by changemakers and leaders that empower you to use your voice to make banking work for people
To be a part of the energy of an organization that is unlike any other, where you may pinch yourself on the daily and wonder how you got so lucky
Bragging rights! You get to call yourself a Transformer and an ATBer and know you play a direct role in helping us become a cutting edge financial institution (it’s going to feel more like a technology company, but either way it’s hella cool.)
So what can ATB Financial offer you? Imagine paying less for your everyday banking, mortgages, loans and investments.
