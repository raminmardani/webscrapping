Our associates serve with humility and a deep respect for their responsibility in helping our customers achieve their goals and realize their dreams. Together, we are on a quest to change banking for good.

When we launched as a startup we disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and the relational database, cutting edge technology in 1988!

Proactive: You will want to share your knowledge with your peers and contribute back to inner/open source projects which you might consume.

You enjoy being a leader and an influencer. In this role, you will work with the project team, client executives and the entire spectrum of PMs (project, product, program and any similar roles that a client may have) - to progress the goal of shipping the right product to the client's users.

You bring a balanced, holistic and flexible mindset to product development. We share the overall success of the product with our clients. This means that we don't just help our clients ship features, or define and validate product direction. We do what needs to be done to ensure that both the product and the engagement are successful.

You are comfortable with ambiguity. We work in an iterative and incremental way, balancing many different inputs and constantly making trade-offs. This requires us to be comfortable moving forward with imperfect information.

The measurements are essential for our products and services, but various calculations are needed when using the data for modelling and analysis. I’m working on the systems that help the numbers flow through complex pipelines of calculations and validations. Other engineers and data scientists build the actual algorithms using the tools in our team.

I also work on an internal web-based tool that anyone in Eniram can use to get the data they need, manipulate it with state-of-the-art scientific libraries and create analyses and visualizations. This is done in so-called “notebooks” which can be shared and used by all co-workers.

My typical day is a mixture of intensive software development work, urgent support and maintenance tasks, and facilitating teamwork on high-level software and data architecture. Energetic and social working days in the office are balanced by concentrated coding, which is sometimes best done in peace and isolation at my home office or even from the countryside.

I’ve always enjoyed seeing the results of my work making other people’s work easier, faster and more satisfying.

We are endlessly curious, passionate collaborators that care deeply about bringing both fresh solutions and measurable results to our clients. We are embedded and indispensable partners to the sales org and use our deep knowledge of marketing, digital advertising (including mastery of Twitter), and brand-knowledge to influence and deliver outstanding creative and strategic solutions.

Partnering with the top brands in the world, we build ideas that are audience-led, insights-driven, measurable, on-brand, and ultimately lead to a memorable and seamless experience for the end-user. The team is tasked with both “thinking big” and “thinking pragmatically” on behalf of advertisers.

We care about the user experience and design creative solutions that will be useful and delightful for them while also delivering against brands’ objectives/KPIs. We aren’t here for fluff creative or to win awards (although we certainly do!), we are here to generate compelling creative ideas and consultation, rooted in a strategic understanding of brands and Twitter.

What You’ll Do

You will be an embedded senior partner to the sales team, dedicated to driving business through both creative and strategic thinking and outputs. You will leverage your experience as a marketer, thought leader, and people leader to oversee all elements of the creative process from ideation to pitch through execution. This role involves working directly with teams within Brand Strategy (Innovation, Production) as well as across Twitter (Research, Content Partnerships, Marketing, Legal). You will be looked to as the center of excellence for how to creatively drive business forward - both through work directly tied to your accounts as well as through scaled initiatives that deliver value across the org. Your ability to leverage business acumen behind the scenes will be as important as your ability to “stand and deliver” presentations to executive audiences.

Responsibilities & Expectations:

Sustain track record and commitment to developing creative marketing programs that achieve brand objectives, are executed seamlessly, and deliver measurable results.
Represent Twitter as a thought leader and leaned-in partner in client and agency settings.
Be an embedded partner to sales teams, both reactively and proactively working to drive business forward. Bias to yes and ability to establish mutual trust.
Demonstrate success working cross-functionally to build internal relationships that translate in to meaningful outputs (scaled materials / processes that benefit the team) / ability to influence and drive to consensus.
Play for the front of the jersey - you see your success as inextricably tied to the team’s success. You’d rather see others’ names in lights than your own. You do what is right for the business.
Sharp business acumen and professional maturity. Self-starter that has a relentless passion for knowing more and doing their best work, balanced with deep respect for the skills that others bring to the table.
Creative energy and drive to think outside of the box. Leads ideation and brainstorming sessions internally and externally that extract fresh thinking from attendees and results in actionable next steps.
Storyteller: You don’t compile slides - you know the client’s challenge and develop a narrative that makes them feel heard, delivers against their objectives, and illuminates Twitter’s creative potential and measurable value.


Who You Are

We’re looking for a Brand Strategist that excels at crafting human-centric ideas. The ideal candidate is a doer, a creative thinker and can light up a room with their strategic thought, collaborative energy, and drive to do what’s best - for our clients and the business.

Signs you could be successful in this role:

Passion for understanding audiences. You consider yourself part anthropologist, sociologist, data scientist, and investigator, hyper-driven to uncover what makes audiences tick.
Insights Driven. You’re never done asking ‘why’ and are relentless in the pursuit of simple human truths that ground and influence every part of a strategic solution or idea. You know the difference between data and insights.
Focus on Impact. You thrive in finding ways to think big and work smartly. You’re both creative and pragmatic. You have confidence developing and presenting work that is provocative and buzz-worthy, while also delivering against complex measurement models.

A fulfillment center can appear to be a chaotic place. With millions of items moving in and out of an area twice as large as your average theme park every day, a quick peek under the roof would reveal a manic scene. You would see associates, machinery, vehicles, robots, and packages flying about at break-neck speeds and accessing a breathtaking number of shelves and bins that store products. In reality, however, this activity is all highly organized and orchestrated by software, with each movement carefully planned and optimized. However, there are times when mistakes occur: products may disappear, reappear in strange places, become damaged, or worse. When that happens, how does a fulfillment center operating at that size, speed, and scale recover gracefully and with minimal cost? How do we ensure that we meet our commitments to our customers and merchants? How do we find a needle in a haystack when we’re constantly shuffling the haystack around? And how do we do it at extreme scale in an environment of constant growth?

That’s where we come in, the AFT Quality team. Our goal is to prevent entropy in a system in which there are billions of transactions driven by human and robotic input across hundreds of millions of items every year. We must ensure that the virtual and physical state of the world is aligned inside hundreds of Amazon’s fulfillment centers globally. When our job is done well mistakes are corrected quickly, and products are always ready to sell and ship.

We operate at a nexus of machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and healthy measure of hard-earned expertise in operations to build automated, algorithmic approaches to solving these problems at minimal cost. We create cutting edge software, building automated processes and workflows in the most complex operational problem space in the business world. So what should you expect from this role?

You will identify the biggest opportunities in Amazon's Fulfillment Centers
You will analyze the potential customer and financial impacts
You will work with in-house scientists, global operations teams, retail organizations, and software teams to identify new features and projects
You will be able to draw on the full range of AWS services as the backbone of your solutions.
You will join a group of the best engineers in the world, and operate in a set of interconnected small teams with absolute ownership in your domain.
You will identify ways to automate analysis through smarter software systems
You will track the realized savings and impacts, and communicate results with senior leaders

391,Campus Alberta Innovates Program (CAIP) Research Chair,University of Calgary,"Calgary, AB",9 days ago,"As part of its implementation strategy, the University of Calgary is funding a Campus Alberta Innovates Program (CAIP) Research Chair in the area of Aquatic Ecosystem Health. Protecting Alberta’s river systems is critical to the sustainability of industry, and Alberta’s natural resources. Effects within watersheds are cumulative, and current management approaches are informed by a variety of poorly aligned monitoring approaches that lack a common framework, regulatory approach, philosophy, and methodology. Cumulative effects assessment needs to be better integrated through regional environmental assessment and regional environmental effects frameworks that connect to regulatory and policy assurance including regional land use planning processes.
Working with relevant government agencies, industry-based partners, and stakeholder organizations, the strategic objective of the CAIP Chair will be to:
conduct innovative research on the assessment and prediction of cumulative environmental effects;
develop and validate novel cumulative effects approaches that integrate the monitoring and assessment of ecological and environmental indicators into direct application for resource management decision-making;
create a functioning network of inter- and trans-disciplinary expertise that focuses on the analysis, interpretation and synthesis of complex environmental data.
Research under this CAIP Chair will advance adaptive monitoring approaches, programs and systems, which can underpin a regional watershed-based integrated management system. The emphasis will be on conceptualizing, designing, and operating programs that are supported by hypothesis-driven science and research aligned to adverse outcome pathways to better link monitoring systems into an assessment and management system to identify, manage and mitigate cumulative effects. The focus will be to develop approaches and strategies for mobilizing and integrating the knowledge to help transform provincial and national strategies for sustainability of aquatic systems.
The Chair will collaborate with industry, government, academic and indigenous partners throughout Alberta’s drainage basins, and will develop integrated approaches for addressing cumulative effects at a watershed scale. The Chair will link to developing and existing University of Calgary expertise in aquatic sciences (hydrology, ecotoxicology, aquatic ecology, water quality), as well as the Water and Energy, (other areas) and to other CAIP Chairs. The Chair will be contributing to a University-AEP collaborative program.
The appointment to the CAIP Chair will be for a seven (7) year period and will be at the rank of Associate Professor or Professor and salary commensurate with experience. The position will be in the Faculty of Science.
Applicants at the associate professor level must provide evidence of an established, externally funded research program, a strong publication record, evidence of successful teaching and graduate supervision, and evidence of established academic engagements in professional and other communities.
Applicants at the full professor level must provide evidence of a well-established funded research program, outstanding academic publication record, evidence of a fully established, demonstrated ability to lead research teams, outstanding teaching and graduate supervision record, and evidence of academic service and/or leadership.
As per CAIP Research Chair award requirements, this Chair position is intended for academic scholars residing outside of Alberta, however, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows that reside within Alberta may apply for the position.
Qualifications:
PhD in Aquatic Ecosystem Health.
An outstanding and externally well funded research program.
A track record of capacity-building, knowledge translation, and working collaboratively and effectively with government, academic and Indigenous partners, is an asset.
Developing monitoring frameworks and regional, provincial and national monitoring programs.
Effectively collaborating with industry, governments and stakeholders including Indigenous communities and experts.
Leading aquatic scientist with international recognition.
Familiarity with aquatic monitoring systems internationally, nationally and provincially.
Familiarity with the policy and regulatory construct in Alberta and key science and knowledge gaps associated with regulatory and policy assurance.
Knowledge of the cumulative effects assessment practice in Canada and Alberta including in the oil sands region and under the Oil Sands Monitoring Program.

We can transform banking, reimagine it, make banking work for people. We’re on a journey to make meaningful impacts on an industry that has the power to transform a person’s life. When we talk about transformation at ATB Financial, we’re not just talking about pie in the sky ideas, we’re listening and collaborating to bring those ideas to life. To put it simply, we’re on a mission to reinvent how banking can support people's lives. We’re going to provide meaningful solutions to problems, deepen our connection with customers and while we’re at it, transform ourselves from the inside out.
We need collaborative visionaries and executors who are eager to listen to our customers in order to do things other banks wouldn’t do. We’re building a team of relentless, passionate and inquisitive ATB transformers to build our bench strength in disrupting ourselves before we get disrupted.
Want to be a part of our story? If you’re looking for an organization where you can use your talents to do remarkable things, you may be the alpha to our beta and we encourage you to read on.

THE OPPORTUNITY:
We use data science to transform banking. Through predictive modeling and machine learning, we anticipate our customers’ needs and connect them to ATB experts and solutions. As a Senior Customer Analyst you love to solve new problems. You are a tremendous collaborator who works effectively with a variety of stakeholders: customer-facing staff, business managers, data scientists and information architects. You are curious and always looking for ways to better understand customer needs and behaviour, to make data processes more efficient, and to learn and apply cutting edge techniques.
Job Requirements
KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS & ABILITIES:
You have experience using data transformation and manipulation to inform predictive modeling and algorithm development (e.g., SQL, SAS, R, Python)
Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience in computer science, statistics, physics, mathematics, economics or a related field
You’ve worked with different types of data infrastructures (e.g., data warehouses or data lakes)
You have experience applying business logic and statistical techniques to data in order to develop and communicate customer insights from various data sources
You have some experience with Machine Learning and are curious to keep learning and improving your skills in this area
You have some experience in cloud computing (AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, etc..) and are curious to keep learning and improving your skills in this area
You can take those intricate processes involved in manipulating and and analyzing data, break them down, and turn them into something that is more efficient and robust
You’ve got an open-source mindset - you can make the connection between a new problem and existing algorithms to create new value
ATTRIBUTES FOR SUCCESS:
You focus on impact over hard work: what isn't of a concern is the hours you work, but your results and impact on team members and customers
You like to solve difficult problems, together: no one said transforming banking was going to be easy, but we’re collectively reimagining it and there are no solo heroes welcome
You operate with a mentality of Build-Measure-Learn: our agile mindset is not just for our technical teams, it's a mindset that every one of us is asked to operate from. We move fast, we make mistakes but we measure the impact, learn, grow and change as a result
You focus on 10X and leave the incremental thinking at home: if something doesn't have significant impact, you are the person to challenge whether or not it's worth doing
You do it with passion or not at all: you’re inspired by our purpose and you see the link between yourself and the work you are doing to transform banking
You’re comfortable with being uncomfortable: we won’t always have the answers and change is a constant in our world. As a Transformer you trust in our vision and own an attitude of willingness and patience
You keep the customer at the heart of everything you do: Empathy is a core driver in which you navigate the world. You don’t build products, processes and solutions for the sake of checking something off your checklist, you build with the end user in mind, openly engaging new ideas, listening with intent and making decisions with the desire to balance both compassion with logical reasoning
As a team member with the Transformation team at ATB, you can expect:
No day will ever be the same - we’re learning, iterating and making big steps towards our vision of transforming an entire industry, everyday

647,"Campus Alberta Innovates Program (CAIP) Research Chair, Aquatic Ecosystem Health",The University of Calgary,"Calgary, AB",9 days ago,"Calgary, ABPosition Description
As part of its implementation strategy, the University of Calgary is funding a Campus Alberta Innovates Program (CAIP) Research Chair in the area of Aquatic Ecosystem Health. Protecting Alberta’s river systems is critical to the sustainability of industry, and Alberta’s natural resources. Effects within watersheds are cumulative, and current management approaches are informed by a variety of poorly aligned monitoring approaches that lack a common framework, regulatory approach, philosophy, and methodology. Cumulative effects assessment needs to be better integrated through regional environmental assessment and regional environmental effects frameworks that connect to regulatory and policy assurance including regional land use planning processes.
Working with relevant government agencies, industry-based partners, and stakeholder organizations, the strategic objective of the CAIP Chair will be to:
conduct innovative research on the assessment and prediction of cumulative environmental effects;
develop and validate novel cumulative effects approaches that integrate the monitoring and assessment of ecological and environmental indicators into direct application for resource management decision-making;
create a functioning network of inter- and trans-disciplinary expertise that focuses on the analysis, interpretation and synthesis of complex environmental data.
Research under this CAIP Chair will advance adaptive monitoring approaches, programs and systems, which can underpin a regional watershed-based integrated management system. The emphasis will be on conceptualizing, designing, and operating programs that are supported by hypothesis-driven science and research aligned to adverse outcome pathways to better link monitoring systems into an assessment and management system to identify, manage and mitigate cumulative effects. The focus will be to develop approaches and strategies for mobilizing and integrating the knowledge to help transform provincial and national strategies for sustainability of aquatic systems.
The Chair will collaborate with industry, government, academic and indigenous partners throughout Alberta’s drainage basins, and will develop integrated approaches for addressing cumulative effects at a watershed scale. The Chair will link to developing and existing University of Calgary expertise in aquatic sciences (hydrology, ecotoxicology, aquatic ecology, water quality), as well as the Water and Energy, (other areas) and to other CAIP Chairs. The Chair will be contributing to a University-AEP collaborative program.
The appointment to the CAIP Chair will be for a seven (7) year period and will be at the rank of Associate Professor or Professor and salary commensurate with experience. The position will be in the Faculty of Science.
Applicants at the associate professor level must provide evidence of an established, externally funded research program, a strong publication record, evidence of successful teaching and graduate supervision, and evidence of established academic engagements in professional and other communities.
Applicants at the full professor level must provide evidence of a well-established funded research program, outstanding academic publication record, evidence of a fully established, demonstrated ability to lead research teams, outstanding teaching and graduate supervision record, and evidence of academic service and/or leadership.
As per CAIP Research Chair award requirements, this Chair position is intended for academic scholars residing outside of Alberta, however, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows that reside within Alberta may apply for the position.
Qualifications:
PhD in Aquatic Ecosystem Health.
An outstanding and externally well funded research program.
A track record of capacity-building, knowledge translation, and working collaboratively and effectively with government, academic and Indigenous partners, is an asset.
Developing monitoring frameworks and regional, provincial and national monitoring programs.
Effectively collaborating with industry, governments and stakeholders including Indigenous communities and experts.
Leading aquatic scientist with international recognition.
Familiarity with aquatic monitoring systems internationally, nationally and provincially.
Familiarity with the policy and regulatory construct in Alberta and key science and knowledge gaps associated with regulatory and policy assurance.
Knowledge of the cumulative effects assessment practice in Canada and Alberta including in the oil sands region and under the Oil Sands Monitoring Program.
Interested individuals are encouraged to submit an application online via the 'Apply Now' link. Please be aware the application process allows for only four attachments. Your four attachments should be organized to contain the following (which may require you to merge documents such as publications):
Cover letter, curriculum vitae and names and contact information of three (3) references
Statement of research interests and a description of a proposed five (5) year research plan for the Chair

Work environment
Ontario's historic canals are defining features of Canada and provide communities and visitors with beauty, recreation, and a unique sense of history. Parks Canada plays a leadership role in the protection of these special places.

The Trent-Severn Waterway is a National Historic Site, 386 km in length, which links Lake Ontario at Trenton with Lake Huron at Port Severn on Georgian Bay and attracts about 1.4 million visitors each year offering heritage tourism and recreation.

From the heart of Canada’s capital, the historic Rideau Canal waterway winds south from Ottawa through towns, farms and woodlands for 202 kilometres (126 miles) towards Kingston on Lake Ontario. Constructed after the War of 1812 on fears of an American invasion of the St. Lawrence River, it served as an alternative shipping route between Montréal and Kingston.

The working canal, with its 19th century locks and structures, links rivers and lakes with man-made channels - an ideal landscape for outdoor activities and glimpses of Old Ontario on a watery route through living history.

689,Senior Data Scientist,Primal,"Kitchener, ON",2 days ago,"About Primal
Increasingly, people are demanding highly tailored services to compensate for their busy lives. To address this demand, computers and software need to understand individual interests. Typically, “big data” statistical models are applied to solve this problem today, but often the big data required to compute statistically relevant results is simply not available to anyone not named Google or Facebook. Even for those juggernauts, scale is only achieved by relying on the grouping individuals into buckets of like interests (i.e. friends in a social graph). This makes a lot of assumptions about individuals, and often those assumptions are wrong. How often is content in the “recommended for you” section of a website relevant to your interests? As people demand better and more personalized attention, the need to solve this problem is a big multi-billion-dollar opportunity.

The Primal Solution

Primal is an artificial intelligence (AI) solution that can derive meaning in the form of knowledge models in real time and from sparse information.
